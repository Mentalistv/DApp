You just need have a C++ compiler installed to run the simulation code.

Compile the code using the following command:
`g++ simulation.cpp`
this generates a executable file `a.out`

Usage directions:
`./a.out <total nodes> <fraction of malicious> <fraction of more trustworthy honest nodes> <% wealth with malicious>`

The simulation results will be printed on the console itself!
